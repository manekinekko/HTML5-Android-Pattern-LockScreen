HTML5-Android-Pattern-LockScreen
================================

A proof of concept project illustrating the use of the Android Pattern LockScreen inside a HTML5 Canvas.
This project is written in Coffee-script and the canvas manipulation is done using the Kinetic.js library.


This system could be used in some login authentication. It may be extended to be used as a captcha (however, this needs to be POC-ed ^^).

Feel free to commit patches or bugfixes. Any new ideas or notes are welcome.

DISCLAIMER 
================================

This project is in its Prouf of Concept stage. Please don't use it in your production app (for now!)
